        <p>
            Tornado is really protective of his work and doesn't want anyone messing with it. You know what happens to those who bother him? He'll scare them off in not-so-nice ways... Oh, and when there's office drama with Fries, you better watch out!

    detail: `
        <p>Tornado Potato will spawn Tornados when they are far away from the player</p>
        <p>If the player gets too close, Tornado Potato will dig underground and track the player in an attempt to hit them.</p>
        <p>If a Tornado touches a Salt, it has a high chance of spraying more Salt.</p>
