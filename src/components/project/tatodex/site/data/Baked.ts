        <p>Baked is an old timer. He knows how to do many things, even the most obscure tasks; and he does them well. He's also aware of all the company's policies and will avoid trouble; playing by the book.</p>
        <p>He's the wise grandfather-figure you admire in the office.</p>

            Baked will roll away from the player if they get too close, but will go head on if there are no escape routes.

            Baked will also shoot Spring Onions or Butter depending on how far the player is.
            Spring Onions will catch on fire if it hits Hot Potato's Flames.

            He will, however, become happy again when Mashed take him for a break.
