In Chip's absence, Crumb steps into a quasi-leadership role, growing the team with dedication and precision.\r\n\r\n// All good things must crumb to an end...\r\n// -\r\n\r\n// Crumblings:\r\n// Just like every devoted cult follower, Crumblings are loyal to their leaders, and will follow any blindly. Heck, they can even get distracted by them. Despite their small size, they will never shut up; vocalising their undying support and fiercely protecting their leaders at any sign of threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n// Size doesn't matter, loyalty does.\r\n// -\r\n","<template>\r\n  <h1>PotatoDex</h1>\r\n    <main>\r\n      <div id=\"potato-viewer\">\r\n        <video ref=\"potatoVideo\" :src=\"currentPotato.video\" autoplay muted loop></video>\r\n        <div class=\"text-content\">\r\n          <h2>{{ currentPotato.name }}</h2>\r\n          <div v-html=\"currentPotato.description\"></div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <ul id=\"potato-list\">\r\n        <li v-for=\"(potato, index) in potatoes\" :key=\"potato.name + index\" class=\"potato-list-item\"  \r\n        :class=\"{ 'potato-list-item--active': currentIndex === index }\"\r\n         @click=\"onSelectPotato(index)\"\r\n        >\r\n          <img class=\"potato-icon\" :src=\"potato.icon\">\r\n          <p>{{ potato.name }}</p>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </main>\r\n  </template>\r\n  \r\n<script setup>\r\nimport { ref, computed, nextTick } from 'vue';\r\nimport { potatoes } from './data/Potatoes';\r\nconst currentIndex = ref(0);\r\nconst potatoVideo = ref()\r\n\r\nconst currentPotato = computed(() => {\r\n  return potatoes[currentIndex.value]\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst onSelectPotato = async (index) => {\r\n  setSelectedIndex(index)\r\n  await nextTick()\r\n  scrollToVideo()\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst setSelectedIndex = (index) => {\r\n  currentIndex.value = index\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst scrollToVideo = () => {\r\n  potatoVideo.value.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\nh1 {\r\n  background-color: #232321;\r\n  font-size: 5rem;\r\n  padding: 2rem 5rem 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  color: #f0f0f0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain {\r\n  background-color: #232321;\r\n  padding: 2rem 5rem 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#potato-viewer {\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  height: 500px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n  Video width will be 500 / 4 * 3 since video is in 3:4 format\r\n*/\r\n#potato-viewer video {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-content {\r\n  width: calc(100% - 375px);\r\n  margin-left: calc(375px + 2rem);\r\n  padding: 0.5rem 1.5rem;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  color: white;\r\n  font-size: 1.7rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-content h2 {\r\n  font-size: 3rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#potato-list {\r\n  padding: 2rem 0;\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  list-style: none;\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\r\n  border-radius: 12px;\r\n  box-shadow: 8px 8px 33px black;\r\n  margin-top: 2rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.potato-list-item {\r\n  width: calc(100% / 6);\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  color: white;\r\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\r\n  filter: brightness(0.6) blur(0.3px);\r\n  transition: 0.3s;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.potato-list-item:hover {\r\n  filter: none;\r\n  transform: scale(1.2);\r\n  cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.potato-list-item--active {\r\n  filter: none;\r\n  transform: scale(1.2);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.potato-icon {\r\n  height: 90px;\r\n  width: 90px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media only screen and (max-width: 991px) {\r\n  .text-content {\r\n    margin-left: calc(375px + 1.5rem);\r\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .text-content h2 {\r\n    font-size: 2.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .potato-list-item {\r\n    width: calc(100% / 4);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media only screen and (max-width: 774px) {\r\n  .potato-list-item {\r\n    width: calc(100% / 3);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #potato-viewer {\r\n    height: unset;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  #potato-viewer video {\r\n    position: unset;\r\n    height: unset;\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .text-content {\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    margin-left: 0;\r\n    padding: 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 3.5rem;\r\n    padding: 2rem 2rem 0;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  main {\r\n    background-color: #232321;\r\n    padding: 2rem 2rem 0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>","import script from \"./Index.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./Index.vue?vue&type=script&setup=true&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./Index.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=4984560e&scoped=true&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['__scopeId',\"data-v-4984560e\"]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["name","icon","video","description","detail","potatoes","Fries","Fry","Mashed","Chip","Crumb","Crumbling","Baked","Hot","Tornado","Shepherd","currentIndex","ref","potatoVideo","currentPotato","computed","value","onSelectPotato","async","setSelectedIndex","index","nextTick","scrollToVideo","scrollIntoView","behavior","block","__exports__"],"sourceRoot":""}
